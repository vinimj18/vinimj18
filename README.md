## ðŸ§ª About Me

I'm a **Junior QA Engineer** with a strong foundation in **manual testing**, **test automation**, and **API validation**. Over the past year, I've completed over **200+ hours of hands-on training** and built several real-world test projects using:

- âœ… Selenium with Python  
- âœ… Cypress with JavaScript  
- âœ… Postman for API testing  
- âœ… GitHub Actions for CI/CD

Previously, I worked in finance and operations â€” where I built workflows, improved processes, and solved analytical problems. Today, I apply those same skills to ensure **software quality**, **reliability**, and **test coverage**.

Iâ€™m passionate about structured testing, continuous learning, and helping development teams release with confidence.

ðŸŽ¯ **Currently open to remote or hybrid QA opportunities in Europe.**
